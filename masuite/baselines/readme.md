# Baselines

In this folder we include implementations of reinforcement learning baselines for *n* agents.

## pytorch, jax
- [ ] Policy gradient (n-player)
- [ ] Vanilla Actor-critic (n-player)
- [ ] Stackeblerg policy gradient (2-player)
- [ ] Symplectic policy gradient (n-player)
- [ ] Competitive policy gradient (2-player)

## numpy
- [ ] Linear quadratic policy gradient (n-player)
- [ ] Linear quadratic actor critic (n-player)
